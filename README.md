# sql-challenge

This sql-challenge was a lot of fun to tackle. It taught me quite a bit, starting from ERDs to creating relationships between tables. I also learned to properly create the tables and then import data into them in the correct order. 
Once the data was loaded, I learned to sort tables, join tables based on common columns, convert data types, learn to identify proper tables to utilize for a specific ask, amongst other things. 

I have included the sql file that includes the code for the data analysis part of the challenge. I have created an 'Output' directory with all the csv files created as a result of the code executed for the data analysis. I have also included a screen shot of the ERD created for the data modelling aspect of the challenge. The data engineering part of the challenge is self evident through the proper creation of tables and import of the csv files.
